# PROJECT CINEMATRON
Ahoy! Welcome to Cinematron, a simplistic website for movies and tv shows fans.
I chose to build this web application because one of the things I found very interesting in Finance was the API. Since it wasn't taught in class, I had to learn from scratch. In this web application, I built seven different API URLs. I also expanded my knowledge of python, jinja, CSS, and HTML.
Languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- SQLite3
- Jinja2

APIs:
- [IMDB](https://imdb-api.com/api)
- [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement)

#### Video Demo:
#### Description:
On the index page, you'll see the bests movies and TV shows ever released per [IMDB's](https://www.imdb.com/) rating.
You can also search for a title and receive some matches. Any title you see you can click on "More," and you'll see the title's stars, plot, a link to the trailer, and similar titles.
Registering on the site will give you another functionality: favorites! That's right, you can have your favorites gathered in one place. That'll make it easier to find them, and you only need to click in more to see some similar titles that you may like. Pretty cool, right?
Have you heard about [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/)? Global Avatar (get it?) is an Automattic project to centralize your public information. It means that you can define your avatar and which information will be public. This information is automatically recognized by Cinematron and big brands like WordPress, GitHub, and Slack. Just remember to register on Cinematron with the same email you are registered with at Gravatar.
Now that you're suited up, let's sail!
