## [Academic Honesty Policy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/)
This course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as “be reasonable.” The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. The course’s policy characterizes both sides of that line.

## My considerations of the course
It's a great course, David is probably the best Professor I've seen.

Like many of those taking this class, I discovered a passion: programming.

It's been said that, when it comes to work, everyone has a call. I'm not sure I believe that but the building blocks supporting it may be true:
1. Is a passion
2. Is something you are good at
3. You're helping others

You see, when you find a work that is inside that triple intersection, you can say that you find your work for life. That's how I see programming.
One of the things that made me like programming so bad is that I like pushing the boundaries of knowledge, creating new things that will help people.
After a few codes, I found out that this is one of the things which I can be good at, granted I'm still learning but now I see that this is all I've been doing my whole life; creating "algorithms" to regulate my life and environment.
Need I say anything about the third? In computer science, we're always innovating and creating things that will make people's lives actually better.
