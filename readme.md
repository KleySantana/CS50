Like many of those taking this class, I discovered my passion: programming.
It's been said that, when it comes to work, everyone has a call. I'm not sure I believe it but the building blocks supporting it may be true:
1 - Is a passion
2 - Is something you are good at
3 - You're helping others
You see, when you find a work that is inside that triple intersection, you can say that you find you work for life. That's how I see programming. Is a passion of mine, I'm still learning but now I see that this is all I've been doing my whole life; creating "algorithms" to regulate my life and environment. Need I say anything about the third? Here we're innovating and creating things that will make people's lives actually better
